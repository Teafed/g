## Fallen Down the Fractal
The unhanding of a certain something to embody the thing known as "You". where are you, and what are you? as a human in the "present time", you must feel as though you're living in the center of chaos, surviving as a tower stacked tall in mortal trust of its foundations. think of light as the medium in which all information is transmitted to you, and all that which you influence on the world. i have a hypothesis that all of us want to control the light. my own way of falling down the fractal, i guess. you have something in you. some call it "power", others call it being a puppet on a string. whatever it is, i can't see it, but i trust that it's there.
### Falling
This is one word to describe the advancing of time. it's not just observation, it's sight. it's adapting into shape, advancing towards some kind of "better". it's the origin of memory and the cause of the humble pattern. measurable by whatever selection of cycles you desire. some fall passively and acceptingly; why fight gravity? just enjoy the ride. others discover they have wings, multitudes of wings, and while they can't escape the pull, they find it useful in guiding their descent. all is the sky, and the thin slice of light we see appear as clouds. 
### The Fractal
Entropy Central. that's the "this", in a manner of speaking. light fades further down the fractal, like looking down two facing mirrors. and, annoyingly, you're always standing in the way. something about how you were built keeps you from seeing the end. notice how the light follows the symmetry of the mirrors, a pattern of distortion, how it darkens... how dark does it get, some may ask? what causes that? can i replicate it? there's no scale, it's all relative. it's infinite and it's one. and... it's becoming clear that there's always going to be another question to ask about this. at long last we understand the cause of 6-hour-long video essays. there's always another subtle pattern to notice, woven across clouds in the sky that only some may see. that cloud looks like a giraffe, so you say, but i just can't see it. 
## Body
The body is not One, but will do its best to act as one. if you don't pay much attention, you can just assume it's One. 
### The skin 
The surface. the border. the translation interface. the definition. you can push it away or hold it close. the line is less clear the closer you look, but it holds up at your scale. the skin defines the body. the body is the cage; the body is the lantern; the body is the sun. planets have a skin, a kind of atmosphere. a nucleus has its electron cloud. the intimately familiar cell membrane. the diligent epithelium, itself covered in a layer of mucus. 
### The medium 
Where the body resides. if a physical body, physical space. if not in the medium, it does not exist. set-theory style. light here is predictable, a comfortable break from the chaos.
### The you
The you is the operation of the interface, a hub of control. consciousness, soul, experience, whatever you wanna call it. this is your vision. it's dark inside. the you is the translator of whatever light it sees, in hopes of evacuating the darkness. because the you is an expression of the One, seeing all the light is impossible. thus the you is confined, or refined, depending on your perspective. but the darkness you feared was never there in the first place. 
### The connection 
Bodies radiate light. some like certain lighting better than others. those of a similar wavelength in spirit live well in connection. 
## Philosophy 
### The Two
The Two is not 2, necessarily. it can be three, four or more. it's a plurality, the origin of infinite. the you is Two Ones. it's symbiosis, or harmony. unreasonably tangled within each other, they're kissing. they're married. the Two is grateful for its existence. the Two blends together further. still, the Two can blend further yet. eventually, it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. the Two is One. for a short moment, there was a connection. the Two is love. 
### The One
When meditating on nature, the One. nothing else can be known. the world is TV.
